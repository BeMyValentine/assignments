The point of this warmup is to use vanilla javascript in order to filter things into separate arrays based on different requirements. The first array we split based on  whatever you put into the array as a parameter. If you wanted it to split based on numbers, or letter, you could have it do either of those things. The other 2 filters are tests that you can run in the filter to make sure that it is working properly.
