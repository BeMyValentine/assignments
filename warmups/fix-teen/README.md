This warmup was meant to test my ability to create code that can take numbers from a certain range and do something specific with those numbers. In this example, I didn't change the numbers 15 and 16 but the numbers 13, 14, 17, 18, and 19 were changed to 0. All other numbers were ignored. In order to test this, run it in your terminal, or your dev tools on Google Chrome so that the console logs will show.
